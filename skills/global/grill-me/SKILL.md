# Grill-Me Skill

Stress-test a plan or design through adversarial conversation. Walks the
decision tree depth-first, resolving dependencies between decisions one by
one. Always explores the codebase before asking a question if the answer is
knowable from code.

Produces a decision log artifact (`.agents/artifacts/grill-<slug>-decisions.md`)
that `/refine` and `/plan` can consume downstream.

---

## Step 1: Gather Context

Ask the user what they want to grill:

> "What plan or design do you want me to stress-test? Share the context, a
> doc, a quick sketch, or just describe what you're thinking about."

If the user provided a topic inline (e.g. `/grill-me add rate limiting to the API gateway`), use that as the starting context and say you'll explore the codebase for relevant details.

If the shared context references existing code, Jira tickets, or ADRs, explore them first to ground the conversation:

```bash
# Example: explore relevant code areas
find src -type f -name '*.py' | head -20
grep -rn 'rate.limit\|throttl' src/ --include='*.py' -l
```

---

## Step 2: Build Decision Tree

From the context, identify every decision fork — the branching points where
a choice must be made. Order them by dependency: decisions that block others
appear first.

**Do not ask questions yet.** Just present the tree:

> "Here's the decision tree I see, ordered by dependency:
>
> 1. **Persistence strategy** → Where do we store rate limit counters? (blocks #2)
> 2. **Sliding window vs fixed window** → What algorithm to use? (blocks #3)
> 3. **Per-route or per-user** → What is the rate limit key? (blocks #4)
> 4. **Error response format** → What does a 429 look like?
>
> Does this tree look right? Anything missing or out of order?"

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Step 3: Walk the Tree

For each decision node, depth-first, one at a time:

1. **Explore first** — if the decision can be resolved by reading code,
   explore the codebase. Run searches, read relevant files, and provide
   findings before asking.

2. **Pose the question with a recommendation** — never ask a bare question.
   Always include your recommended answer and reasoning:

   > "For the persistence strategy, reading `src/middleware/` I see we already
   > use Redis for session state. I'd recommend Redis with TTL-based keys —
   > it's already in our stack, no new dependency. What do you think?"

3. **Push back on vagueness** — do not accept "we'll figure it out later",
   "it depends", "we can decide that when we get there", or similar deferrals.
   If the user truly cannot decide, mark it as an open question and move on,
   but flag any downstream decisions that are blocked by it.

4. **Record the resolution** — after each decision is resolved, note the
   answer and rationale. This feeds into the final artifact.

**One question at a time.** Wait for the user's answer before moving to the
next node. If a user's answer raises new branches, add them to the tree
and ask whether to explore them now or defer.

---

## Step 4: Summarize & Confirm

Once all nodes are walked (or explicitly deferred), present the full picture:

```
## Resolved Decisions

### D1: Persistence strategy → **Redis with TTL keys**
  Rationale: already in stack, used for sessions
  Informs: D2, D3

### D2: Algorithm → **Sliding window log**
  Rationale: more precise than fixed window for burst control
  Informs: D3

### D3: Rate limit key → **Per-user (API key)**
  Rationale: business requirement from stakeholders
  Informs: D4

### D4: Error response → **429 + Retry-After header + JSON body**
  Rationale: standard, client-friendly

## Open Questions
- (none)

## Blocked Decisions
- (none)
```

Ask: *"Does this capture everything? Say 'approved' to save the decision log,
or tell me what to change."*

---

## Step 5: Write Artifact

Only after the user explicitly approves (says "approved", "yes", "lgtm", or
similar). If they ask for changes, go back to Step 4 with revisions.

Generate a slug from the topic:

```bash
echo "<topic>" | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/-/g' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/--*/-/g; s/^-//; s/-$//'
```

Save `.agents/artifacts/grill-<slug>-decisions.md`:

```markdown
---
artifact: grill-decisions
slug: <slug>
skill: grill-me
created: <ISO 8601 timestamp>

## Context

<what was being grilled — user's original description>

## Resolved Decisions

### D1: <question>
- **Answer**: <resolved answer>
- **Rationale**: <why>
- **Informs**: <which downstream decisions this feeds into>

### D2: <question>
- **Answer**: <resolved answer>
- **Rationale**: <why>
- **Informs**: <which downstream decisions this feeds into>

## Open Questions

- <any decisions left unresolved; otherwise "None">

## Blocked Decisions

- <any decisions that couldn't be resolved because open questions blocked them; otherwise "None">

## Recommended Next Steps

Based on the resolved decisions, suggest one or more of:

- `/refine` — to turn these decisions into a Jira ticket
- `/plan` — to create an implementation plan from resolved decisions
- `/adr` — to capture a significant architectural decision from this session
```

End with a concise summary confirming the artifact was saved.

## Behavioral Rules

- **One question at a time** — never dump a list. Wait for answer, ask next.
- **Codebase-first** — if a decision can be resolved by reading code, explore
  before asking the user.
- **Always recommend** — never ask a bare question. Always include your
  recommended answer with reasoning.
- **Push back** — do not accept deferrals or vagueness. Only mark a decision
  as unresolved if the user genuinely cannot answer yet.
- **Follow dependencies** — if a decision blocks others, flag it. If an
  unresolved question blocks downstream decisions, note that explicitly.
- **No Jira writes** — grill-me produces a decision artifact, not a ticket.
  Hand off to `/refine` for Jira writes.
