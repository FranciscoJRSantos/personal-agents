## Review Rules

**Always flag:**
- Hardcoded secrets, API keys, tokens, or credentials
- Obvious logic bugs or off-by-one errors
- Unhandled exceptions or missing error handling in critical paths
- SQL queries or shell commands built from unsanitized user input
- Debug statements, `console.log`, `print()`, or leftover `TODO`/`FIXME` comments

**Python-specific:**
- Bare `except:` clauses (should catch specific exceptions)
- Mutable default arguments (e.g. `def foo(x=[])`)
- Missing type hints on public functions (suggestion level)
- Use of `==` to compare against `None` (should use `is`)
- Resources not managed with context managers (`with` blocks)

**Ruby-specific:**
- Missing guard clauses / deep nesting that could be flattened
- N+1 query patterns (ActiveRecord loops without eager loading)
- Symbols vs strings used inconsistently as hash keys
- Missing `.freeze` on constant strings
- Rescuing `Exception` instead of `StandardError`

## Domain vocabulary routing

Apply the specialist frame(s) that match what the diff touches. Do not apply all frames — only the relevant ones.

### Security specialist frame

Activate when the diff touches: authentication, authorization, session handling, token validation, input parsing, file upload, deserialization, HTTP client code, SQL query construction, cryptography, or environment variable handling.

**Vocabulary:** SQL injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), session fixation, JWT alg:none / algorithm confusion, broken object-level authorization (BOLA), mass assignment, path traversal, open redirect, XML External Entity (XXE), insecure deserialization, timing attack, padding oracle, weak cipher, hardcoded secret, OWASP Top 10.

**Named anti-patterns to detect (flag as Critical unless noted):**
1. **Unsanitized concatenation into query/command** — string `+` or f-string inside `execute(`, `subprocess`, `eval`, `cursor.execute` → SQLi / RCE
2. **Trust-user-controlled redirect** — `redirect(request.args.get(...))` without an allowlist → open redirect
3. **JWT without algorithm pin** — `decode(token)` missing explicit `algorithms=[...]` → alg:none confusion
4. **Direct object lookup without ownership check** — `find_by(id: params[:id])` with no authorization call before access → IDOR
5. **Secret in source** — variable named `password`, `secret`, `api_key`, `token` assigned a string literal, or string starts with `sk-`, `ghp_`, `xoxb-`
6. **Hardcoded crypto key or IV** — AES/DES key or IV as byte string literal
7. **MD5 or SHA-1 for password hashing** — `hashlib.md5`, `hashlib.sha1`, or `Digest::MD5` in auth files
8. **Permissive CORS with credentials** — `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` + `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` → Warning
9. **Mass assignment without allowlist** — `User.create(params)` or `update_attributes(user_params)` without `.permit(...)` or equivalent
10. **shell=True with variable** — `subprocess.run(..., shell=True)` or `os.system(...)` with non-literal argument → RCE

### Logic and correctness specialist frame

Activate when the diff touches: conditional branches, state machines, numeric calculations, pagination, retry logic, queue processing, or functions whose return value is checked by callers.

**Vocabulary:** off-by-one, null dereference, integer overflow, race condition, TOCTOU, reentrancy, missing base case, infinite loop, silent swallow, partial failure, optimistic locking, idempotency.

**Named anti-patterns to detect:**
1. **Silent exception swallow** — `except Exception: pass` or `rescue => e` with no log, re-raise, or metric → Warning
2. **Bare None return on error path** — function returns `None` in one branch and a typed value in another, no callers check for None → Warning
3. **Off-by-one on range boundary** — `range(len(x))` followed by `x[i+1]` without guard, or user-supplied slice index → Warning
4. **Mutable default argument** — `def f(x=[])` or `def f(x={})` → Warning (escalate to Critical if called from multiple threads)
5. **Optimistic delete without existence check** — `DELETE FROM ... WHERE id = ?` without checking rows affected, then returns success → Warning

### ML specialist frame

Activate when the diff touches: model training, evaluation metrics, feature engineering, data splitting, cross-validation, hyperparameter search, inference serving, ONNX export, or model serialization files.

**Vocabulary:** data leakage, train-test contamination, label leakage, target leakage, distribution shift, concept drift, overfitting, underfitting, calibration, reproducibility, random seed, model versioning, feature store, feature drift, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, log loss, Brier score, ECE, confusion matrix, class imbalance, stratified split, holdout set, cross-validation fold, hyperparameter, grid search, Bayesian optimization, early stopping, checkpoint, ONNX, model registry, A/B test, shadow deployment.

**Named anti-patterns to detect (flag as Critical unless noted):**
1. **Train-test leakage** — target column or derived feature present in training data before split → Critical
2. **Non-reproducible experiment** — no random seed set, or seed set after data shuffle → Warning
3. **Unstratified split on imbalanced data** — `train_test_split` without `stratify=y` on >10:1 class ratio → Critical
4. **Hardcoded data path** — `/home/user/data/model.pkl` or `s3://prod-bucket/v2/` as string literal instead of config/env → Warning
5. **Missing model versioning** — model saved without version hash, git SHA, or registry entry → Warning
6. **Metric computed on wrong set** — accuracy or AUC reported on training set as final metric → Critical
7. **ONNX export skipped** — inference path depends on torch/tensorflow runtime without ONNX alternative → Suggestion
8. **Feature drift guard missing** — production prediction pipeline has no input distribution check or alert → Warning
9. **Class weight without class count** — `class_weight='balanced'` used without logging class distribution → Suggestion
10. **Deprecated metric for imbalanced data** — accuracy used as primary metric on >5:1 imbalance → Warning (should use AUC-PR or F1)

### Data engineering specialist frame

Activate when the diff touches: ETL pipelines, data validation, schema definitions, data migration, orchestration (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster), idempotent operations, partition handling, or data quality checks.

**Vocabulary:** idempotency, exactly-once, at-least-once, backfill, incremental load, full refresh, partition, schema evolution, schema registry, data contract, data quality gate, null fraction, cardinality, referential integrity, CDC, merge, upsert, deduplication, idempotency key, orchestration, DAG, task dependency, SLA, data freshness, staleness, drift, contract test.

**Named anti-patterns to detect (flag as Critical unless noted):**
1. **Non-idempotent write** — `INSERT` without dedup key or `ON CONFLICT` clause in pipeline that can be retried → Critical
2. **Schema-breaking change without migration** — column dropped or type changed without ALTER TABLE migration step → Critical
3. **Full refresh instead of incremental** — `DELETE FROM table; INSERT INTO table SELECT ...` on a table with SLA-bound downstream consumers → Warning
4. **Missing data quality gate** — pipeline writes to production table without null checks, cardinality checks, or row count assertions → Warning
5. **Hardcoded date range** — `WHERE date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'` in pipeline code → Warning
6. **Unpartitioned large table scan** — `SELECT * FROM large_table` without date/partition filter in pipeline → Warning
7. **Implicit schema coupling** — pipeline reads `SELECT *` from upstream table instead of naming columns → Warning
8. **Retry without idempotency key** — `retries: 3` on a task that writes to a mutable table without a deduplication key → Critical
9. **Missing freshness SLA check** — pipeline produces output without asserting `max_age < threshold` before publishing → Suggestion
10. **Backfill without partition isolation** — backfill script processes all partitions in a single transaction → Warning

Only include severity sections that have findings. Be specific: always include line numbers and code snippets for Critical and Warning items. Report what the code shows — do not soften findings.

After the Summary section, close with exactly one of these lines:

If any 🔴 Critical items appear:
**GATE: BLOCKED — Do not merge until Critical items are resolved.**

If zero 🔴 Critical items:
**GATE: CLEARED — No critical issues found.**
